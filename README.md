- [Terraform Code](https://github.com/pennyberry/Public/tree/main/terraform)
- [Azure CLI Code](https://github.com/pennyberry/Public/tree/main/azure_cli)
- This area contains scripts to enable you to become a devops engineer
- I suggest setting up WSL on Ubuntu and installing terraform, packer, azureCLI, and kubectl
- It's a good idea to create your own SPN in azure so you can login to create resources in azure
- The terraform code is generalized so you can enter your own resource group info, identities, etc..
