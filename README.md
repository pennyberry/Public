- This area contains scripts to enable you to become a devops engineer
- I suggest setting up WSL on Ubuntu and installing terraform, packer, azureCLI, and kubectl
- It's a good idea to create your own SPN in azure so you can login to create resources in azure
- The terraform code is generalized so you can enter your own resource group info, identities, etc..
